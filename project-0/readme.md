# HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
### Aim
The purpose of this project was to create a website and learn the basics of web development languages, understand how web forms work and explore browser inspect element.

### Tasks
The objective is to build a website with three web pages:
- Google Search Page
- Google Image Search Page
- Google Advance Search Page

For all the 3 web pages make sure the design is user-friendly.

### Learnings
1. **Bootstamp:**
Bootstrap is open-source tool/library which helps in building fancy websites with minimum code. Many of the developers have built and shared there design themes that can be used by anyone.\
To use bootstrap on your webpage, write the below ```link``` tag inside ```head``` tag\
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
```<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">```\


   Visit the the Bootstrap website and checkout there themes, if you like any particular theme, use the web browser **inspect element** option to view the html class tag and mimic the same on your own code.\
   Note: 
   - Styling is applied in the priority order of inline styling, `id` value, `class` value, tag `type`. 
   - Bootstrap divides the page in 12 columns, understanding this helps in better aligning the pages.

2. **Form Variables:**
When we search or login on web page, we can observe the web page URL have a `?` and after that few variables. For example, in case of google, our search query variable name is `q`.

3. **HTML and CSS:**
Both HTML and CSS languages are basic. HTML helps in rendering text, images, form, etc., on a web page. While CSS helps in style the webpage, without CSS websites would be plain text without proper spacing and alignment. CSS allows websites to display dyanamic (flex) contains over different devices.
